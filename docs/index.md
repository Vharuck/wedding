# Marriage of Lacey Jane Shupp and Nathaniel James Werth

## Rambling preamble

Hi, Lacey!  This is going to be our website!

Not much so far, but getting the domain was the part I've never done before.
Creating web pages and organizing all the HTML/CSS/ABCDEFG-crap is a skill I've
picked up from work.

So hooray for the hard first step! And double-hooray for it being behind me!

$13 for a year. This is ours. Probably could've picked a better one.

## Question

Which domain would you rather use?

-   ShuppWerthWedding.com
-   wedding.nathanwerth.com

I'm thinking of registering `nathanwerth.com` for future work, so it dovetails
with that. But it's your wedding more than mine, according to our princess bride
culture, so I wanted you in the name.
